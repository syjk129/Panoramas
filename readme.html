        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this homework assignment, we will focus on the core algorithms behind building a panorama.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Before we get started, download the assignment files under Resources > Assignments > Assignment 8 that contains the files you will be working with. It also contains the assignment description if you wish to view it offline. </p>
        <p>Once you have extracted the zip file above, you are ready to get started.</p>
        <p>As with previous assignments, running <strong> assignment8_test.py </strong> directly will apply a unit test to your code and print out helpful feedback. You can use this to debug your functions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="part1">
        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline">Part 1: Programming the core of panoramas.</h2>

        <p> This is a quick highlight of the functions. assignment6.py has extensive function descriptions with step by step guidelines. </p>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>getImageCorners</strong> </li>
            <p> For an input image, return its four corners. </p>
            <li> <strong>findMatchesBetweenImages</strong> </li>
            <p> Finds the keypoint matches and descriptions between the two images </p>
            <li> <strong>findHomography</strong> </li>
            <p> Returns the homography between the keypoints of image 1, image 2, and its matches. The unit test for this function in the included testing script may have value differences and thus may not pass. If your output warped image looks fine, don't worry too much about this test.</p>
            <li> <strong>warpImagePair</strong> </li>
            <p> Warps image 1 so it can be blended with image 2 (stitched). </p>
            <li> <strong>blendImagePair</strong> </li>
            <p> For Part 1, you can leave this implementation as is.</p>
        </ol>
    </div> <!-- End part 1 -->

    <div id="part2">
        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline">Part 2: Get Creative with Programming and Photography</h2>

        <h3> blendImagePair </h3>
        <p> This is what we want you to modify. We want you to write a function that blends the warped image with the second image at a given point. The simplest implementation is to average pixels where the images overlap. If you do this, try to incorporate a weight
        function from the start of the overlap point so that you get a 'fade' effect and properly transition from image 1 to image 2. You cannot modify the arguments of the function.</p>

        <p> We want you to be creative here. Good blending may be difficult and time-consuming, and we do not expect you to implement a universally perfect and seamless blend. We want to see good effort and creative solutions. Feel free to compare and discuss different high-level approaches with other students. </p>

        <h3> Taking Panorama Images </h3>
        <p> We want you to take 3 images (feel free to take more and test your output) for this panorama. Keep in mind that planar panoramas are much better to visualize than rotational ones, you'll see this in the output, either is fine but you may want to look into the different types to get a better output. </p>

<div id="pdf_details">
<h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline">The Writeup</h2>
<p>This is what we want you to do for the PDF.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Demonstrate your 3+ Input Panorama images </li>
    <li> Demonstrate the Panorama result. </li>
    <li> Explain how you implemented your blendImagePair. We don't need you to explain the other functions but feel free to do so.</li>
</ol>
    <p> Answer the following questions: </p>
<ul>
    <li> What effect did increasing the number of matched features have on your output? You can modify it either in the test file or on the bottom of assignment6.py where we provided some commented out code. Just make sure it is comment it out before submitting if you use that code.</li>
    <li> What type of panorama did you take? </li>
    <li> Were you happy with your result? If so / If not, why? </li>
</ul>
